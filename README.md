# Intro to VR

A quick project created using instructions from [Michael Lumibao](https://github.com/Michaellumibao)'s Hack the North [Intro to VR workshop](https://youtu.be/N33EpKOvNWY).

The project uses Unity and is built for the Oculus Quest 2. 

Some simple features include:
- teleportation across the floor of the scene and snap turning
- importing assets such as background and objects
- basic physics in throwing objects
- simple 2D UI to keep track of number of geese hit with hard hats
